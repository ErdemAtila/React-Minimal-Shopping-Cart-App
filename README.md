# Minimal Shop Application

This project is a minimalistic shopping application built with React. It allows users to browse products, add them to a cart, and manage the quantity of items in the cart.

- **Increment/Decrement Quantity**: Users can easily adjust the quantity of items in the cart.
- **Infinite Scrolling**: Initially displays 10 products and loads 5 more items as the user scrolls down.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures optimal viewing experience across different devices.

## Technologies Used
